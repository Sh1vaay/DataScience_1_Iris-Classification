The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains samples of iris flowers, with samples from each of three different species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.Various classification algorithms can be used to train a model on this dataset. Some common algorithms used are k-nearest neighbors (k-NN),
Logistic regression, and support vector machines (SVM). Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the species of new iris flowers based on their features.Then Plotting is the process of creating visual representations of data. It is an important tool for data analysis and exploration, as it allows us to quickly identify patterns and trends in the data.I used scatter plots, histograms ,correlation matrix.
